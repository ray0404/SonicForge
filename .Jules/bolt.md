# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** The journal file was missing.
**Action:** Created `.jules/bolt.md` (mapped to `.Jules/bolt.md` by the system or just created where told). Wait, the system says `.Jules/` exists. I should create it there if possible, or just follow the instruction which says `.jules/bolt.md`. The previous tool output showed `.Jules/`. I will assume I can create the file.

(Self-correction: I will create it at `.Jules/bolt.md` if I can, or `.jules/bolt.md` if that's what the system prefers. The prompt says "read .jules/bolt.md (create if missing)". I will create it).

Wait, I should not waste a turn just creating the journal if I don't have a learning yet.
"Your journal is NOT a log - only add entries for CRITICAL learnings"
"Before starting, read .jules/bolt.md (create if missing)."

I will create it with the first entry once I have a learning. For now, I know it doesn't exist.

Let's focus on finding the optimization.

I'll check `src/audio/worklets/` for DSP optimization opportunities first, as that's a high-impact area mentioned in `AGENTS.md`.
